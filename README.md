# Quantifying-Spectral-Similarity-Between-Two-Experiments-Using-Network-Analysis

I'd like to perform a detailed comparison of MS/MS spectra obtained from two different experiments. My goal is to quantify and visualize the similarity between two experiments, and then to construct a network that represents the relationships between the different spectral peaks.

To do this, I plan to assign a similarity score (e.g cosine similarity) to each pair of peaks corresponding to the same m/z values.

What are the steps to follow in MzMine to achieve this goal?
